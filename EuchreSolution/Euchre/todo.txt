Planning
- Fix game bugs
- Get all AI stuff working reasonably well
- Do human stuff
- Clean up UI or whatever
- Do enhancements

Bugs
- bidder's hand should match the real state (6 cards when discarding, trump already updated, etc.)
- ai only bids in round 2
- bowers need to be promoted before discard
- you still apparently have 5 cards when you're discarding. the wrong player is being asked to discard somehow?

ToDo
- Update AI API to include params
- Enforce rules
	- When playing a card, make sure the card exists in their hand and that they can legally play it
- Move and rename init
- Pass useful stuff to AIs as params
- Fix decent AI problems
- Move message printing and animations to the controller

- Implement defend alone
- AI difficulties
- Rename decentAI to something less flattering
- rename PlayedCards to CardPlayed?



Clean up
- Validate params
- Use calc css
- Fix up sidebar

Enhancements
- Make it clear when it's your turn
- Cats settings
- Improve UI
- Queue up your next card
	- Get rid of delay at start of player 0's turn
- Recenter hand after cards are played
- If your partner is going alone, you get to see the kitty (meow)
- Speedy (instant) AI players
- Auto-play last trick
- Auto-pass if it's all you can do
- Multiplayer
- Card pack choice
- Make the whole thing resize with window

Low priority game modes
- Stick the dealer
- AIs can see open hands but you can't. No one will find this fun (except Kevin). Do it anyway.
- Game mode where you try to lose

---Reminders---

Keyboard stuff
- ctrl + shift click (go to definition)
- ctrl + shift + right click (go back)
